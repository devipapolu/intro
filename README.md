# intro
“Hi, good morning. First of all, thank you so much for shortlisting my profile and giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is Devi Papolu. I am an AWS DevOps Associate with hands-on experience in provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and maintaining production environments on AWS and Contabo VPS.

I have experience in containerizing applications using Docker, deploying applications behind Nginx reverse proxy with SSL configuration, and using PM2 to ensure continuous application availability.

In my organization, I have worked on multiple projects. I have deployed government projects such as APCRDA and Bihar Election portals developed using React and Node.js. I have also deployed internal and organizational projects like our company website, Skyvolts platform, and other internal applications.

Additionally, I have worked on AI-based projects like a RAG-based AI chatbot, an AI-powered Visitor Management System, and I was involved in AWS to Contabo migration for cost optimization.

I am passionate about automation, secure infrastructure provisioning, and production reliability. Currently, I am also focusing on enhancing my knowledge in DevSecOps and AIOps to become a more complete DevOps professional.”**
